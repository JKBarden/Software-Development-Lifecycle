CS-250 course taken at SNHU going over the Agile Method for project management.

"essential questions” for the Computer Science program

Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A: The user experience is essential for a good program. Making some assumptions during development to try and think about the user's experience will help guide development. Ultimately having users give feedback about the program gives a better average on crucial issues and what issues need to be addressed. User stories are exactly this, give the program to some testers and from their feedback you can create a great user experience. 

Q: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

A: My initial development approach is the top down; I create the program with what comes to mind. Now with the knowledge of the agile method it makes sense to create a sprint. This can help organize the program and my thought process on how they interact with each other. By creating a sprint, I can also create time to have adequate time for testing and implementation. 

Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

A: In general, a good team member is teachable and gets along with everyone. The only difference for software development is a member that is self-sufficient, will actively try to assist other members and become more efficient in coding through their retrospective. The coding aspects as being organized and following agile method can be taught.
